description: "There's a piece in 12 Rules Of Creativity by Michael Atavar that says; At all times in the creative process, great care must be taken to protect your soft and vulnerable qualities. I wrestled with that statement for a long time. I was always taught that creativity was being vulnerable on a page or canvas or so on."
