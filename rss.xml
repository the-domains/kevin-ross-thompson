            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>10 Grooming Tools Every Man Should Own - Gear Patrol</h1><p>One of my favorite stories, " My Father's Fashion Tips," was first published in a 1996 issue of GQ. The author, Tom Junod, details the intricacies, or what he calls the "secrets," of his father's grooming regimen: baby oil to the face, witch hazel in the navel.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4a63ab30a06160c2d9762596c7278b0877cb16f1.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Shaking The Routine and Being Awake - I Create Nothing</h1><p>I will be the first one to stand up and say that I love a good routine. It's comfortable, easy and provides stability. Being married has made me appreciate routines even more, spending time with my wife between jobs and grabbing every last spare moment together.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/85e4b9948f518e6548fccbe42fe21ccb14af37c8.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Books & Coffee: A Love Story - Sprudge</h1><p>A book and a cup of coffee: two of the most comforting things in our modern lives. As the poet R.M. Engelhardt once wrote, "A smoke, a book, a cup of coffee. These are the little things that get us through this sometimes weary world and all the rainy days."</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/271ff4266811a80df12c206860c55a473c47627d.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Creativity, Vulnerability and Shame - I Create Nothing</h1><p>There's a piece in 12 Rules Of Creativity by Michael Atavar that says; At all times in the creative process, great care must be taken to protect your soft and vulnerable qualities. I wrestled with that statement for a long time. I was always taught that creativity was being vulnerable on a page or canvas or so on.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/dddd8bece00704942a67717f872a27d0b4bc58cc.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[EGO, PERSONAL BRANDING AND LEARNING TO LIVE WITH YOURSELF]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>EGO, PERSONAL BRANDING AND LEARNING TO LIVE WITH YOURSELF</h1><p>The term personal branding is one that I’ve come to absolutely hate. I’ve worked in Marketing and Advertising and branding a company is just fine, even if the real brand is what actual people think of the company, but branding yourself seems disingenuous at best. For instance, on Instagram I never have a bad day, even if I don’t use filters. There’s pictures of perfectly framed scenes in Paris, walking through New York City and the moment after I proposed in London, but in reality I spend most of my time behind a computer in Houston. It’s a pretty normal life, but you wouldn’t know it if you only looked at my Instagram feed.</p></article>]]></description>
