            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Books & Coffee: A Love Story - Sprudge</h1><p>A book and a cup of coffee: two of the most comforting things in our modern lives. As the poet R.M. Engelhardt once wrote, "A smoke, a book, a cup of coffee. These are the little things that get us through this sometimes weary world and all the rainy days."</p><img src="http://sprudge.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Sprudge-BooksAndCoffee-AnnaBrones-Tattered-Covers-3-740x555.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Creativity, Vulnerability and Shame - I Create Nothing</h1><p>There's a piece in 12 Rules Of Creativity by Michael Atavar that says; At all times in the creative process, great care must be taken to protect your soft and vulnerable qualities. I wrestled with that statement for a long time. I was always taught that creativity was being vulnerable on a page or canvas or so on.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/dddd8bece00704942a67717f872a27d0b4bc58cc.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[EGO, PERSONAL BRANDING AND LEARNING TO LIVE WITH YOURSELF]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>EGO, PERSONAL BRANDING AND LEARNING TO LIVE WITH YOURSELF</h1><p>The term personal branding is one that I’ve come to absolutely hate. I’ve worked in Marketing and Advertising and branding a company is just fine, even if the real brand is what actual people think of the company, but branding yourself seems disingenuous at best. For instance, on Instagram I never have a bad day, even if I don’t use filters. There’s pictures of perfectly framed scenes in Paris, walking through New York City and the moment after I proposed in London, but in reality I spend most of my time behind a computer in Houston. It’s a pretty normal life, but you wouldn’t know it if you only looked at my Instagram feed.</p></article>]]></description>
