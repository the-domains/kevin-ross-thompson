H. Auden</p></blockquote><p>The term personal branding is one that I’ve come to absolutely hate. I’ve worked in Marketing and Advertising and branding a company is just fine, even if the real brand is what actual people think of the company, but branding yourself seems disingenuous at best. For instance, on Instagram I never have a bad day, even if I don’t use filters. There’s pictures of perfectly framed scenes in Paris, walking through New York City and the moment after I proposed in London, but in reality I spend most of my time behind a computer in Houston. It’s a pretty normal life, but you wouldn’t know it if you only looked at my Instagram feed.</p><p>The “you” that is put out on social media isn’t totally you and that’s fine. Where it becomes a problem is when that becomes the only persona that you put out for other people to see. Personal branding is consciously making yourself look only a certain way in public and to me, that’s just a bit manipulative.</p><p>I started this website after reading <a href="http://www.elizabethgilbert.com/">Elizabeth Gilbert</a>‘s amazing book<em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Big-Magic-Creative-Living-Beyond-ebook/dp/B00S52M350">Big Magic</a></em>. It helped me to focus and really hone in on what I wanted to create and write about. In Big Magic, Gilbert writes, “an unchecked ego is what the Buddhists call a ‘hungry ghost’-forever famished, eternally howling with need and greed.” That to me is what is wrong with personal branding, it appeals only to the ego in people and completely disregards the fact that we all have bad days and sometimes we don’t put the best foot forward.</p><p>As a creative person, ego is something that I constantly have to keep in check. That’s why I usually have my wife proof my work, to show me just how far I have to go in being a consistent writer. It’s a great ego check and also makes it much easier for all of y’all to read this stuff. The musician part of me is the one that I have to keep in check the most. When you write something, the praise or criticism is usually delayed and a bit insulated, but when you finish a song onstage, it’s immediate. You receive pats on the back after you finish, hand claps when a song is over and a general rush of adrenaline that feeds the ego. It’s an amazing feeling but also a bit crippling. After you get that response once, you never want to get any other type. It creates a cycle of ego praise and there’s a lot of musicians that will do anything, including abusing drugs and alcohol, to maintain that feeling. It’s an unchecked ego and personal brand that thrives on perfection and deception.</p><p>No one can be perfect. I’m a huge fan of U2 and Bono and I guarantee you I’ve heard bad notes in many of their performances. It’s unavoidable, even for the best and most seasoned performers. The key is using that imperfection to show the world the real you. That’s a personal brand that I can get behind.</p><blockquote><p>The Ego is an exquisite instrument. Enjoy it, use it – just don’t get lost in it. – Ram Dass</p></blockquote><p>In my opinion, an unchecked ego leads to isolation, delusion and most times, pretty pathetic art. It’s creativity that only is meant to please a certain part of the creator, not the whole. By tapping into the whole you and partnering with creativity to make art, you’re not only going to please your whole self, not just the trumped up version of your personal brand, but other people as well. Not that pleasing other people is always the point, some art needs to be made regardless of what the audience thinks, but the ability to draw others into your world is a connection that can’t be taken lightly.</p><p>I’m horrible at personal branding. That’s part of the reason why this blog is an absolute mess at times. I’m too conscious of others opinions a lot of the time and not conscious enough of what I have to say. Nihar Chhaya, executive coach and president of the leadership development company<a href="http://www.partnerexec.com/">Partner Exec</a> recently talked to<a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3055501/work-smart/how-to-stop-worrying-about-what-others-think-of-you">Fast Co.</a> about worrying what others think about you. “If everything that happens to you is based on someone else giving you the thumbs up or green light, then you’re going to be at the beck and call of external factors,” said Chhaya.

Otherwise, chaos ensues.</p><p>Personal branding and ego can be powerful things, but only if you’re using them in conjunction with those other, messy parts of you that make up who you actually are. Let’s be honest, there’s not much worse than inauthentic art. It’s drab and ends up being sold in flea markets, used in bad infomercials and as wallpaper in avant garde bathrooms. So be you, and only you.
